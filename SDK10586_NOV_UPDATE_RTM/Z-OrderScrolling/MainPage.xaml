Nadella said he &quot;always wanted to build things&quot;.[25] He knew that computer science was what he wanted to
pursue,[26] but that emphasis was not available at Manipal University. &quot;And so it [electrical engineering] was
a great way for me to go discover what turned out to become a passion,&quot; he says.[27]"
