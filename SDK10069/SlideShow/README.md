# SlideShow Sample

This is the sample shown in the //build talk "Use New Motion and Effects Features to Captivate Users and Truly Bring Your 
App to Life".  This sample shows how the new composition API can be just in conjunction with XAML.  This sample also shows
the use of ImageVisuals, Animations, and Effects to make a simple but elegant photo slideshow.  The sample will automatically 
populate the slideshow from photos in your computer's photos folder.
